## 🌟 Why an Android Phone as a Server?

* 🔋 **Built-in Battery UPS**: Immune to sudden power outages — the phone's internal battery keeps the server online 24/7.
* ⚡ **Ultra Low Power**: Consumes only ~2–4W compared to 60–100W+ for traditional desktop or rack servers.
* 📶 **Always Connected**: Built-in Wi-Fi and cellular failover capabilities in a compact, silent footprint.
* ♻️ **Upcycle Old Hardware**: Turn spare smartphones into dependable personal cloud storage and compute servers.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Real-Time Telemetry & Visuals
* 📈 **60-Second Real-Time Telemetry Graph**: Smooth canvas chart displaying real-time CPU %, RAM %, and network traffic over the last minute.
* 🔋 **Battery UPS & Health Guard**: Continuous battery level and temperature monitoring with smart advisory alerts to prevent battery swelling during 24/7 wall power.
* 🌓 **Dark / Light Mode**: Modern responsive interface with an obsidian dark theme, emerald accents, and theme persistence.
* 📱 **Instant Wi-Fi QR Connect**: Built-in QR code modal to connect mobile devices or laptops on your local network instantly without typing IP addresses.
* 🌐 **Zero-Config Remote Access**: 1-click Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) to access your server globally over HTTPS without port forwarding or exposing your home IP.

### 📁 Cloud Storage & File Manager
* 📁 **Web File Manager**: Browse, create folders, download, rename, and delete files safely.
* 📂 **Folder Upload**: Upload entire directories with nested hierarchies preserved.
* 🎬 **In-line Media Preview**: Stream videos, music, and view photos directly inside the browser.
* 🛡️ **Sandboxed Storage**: Access is strictly isolated to `~/server/shared/`, preventing directory traversal escapes (`../`).

### ⚙️ Server Management & Security
* ⚡ **Services Grid**: Real-time status monitoring and PID tracking for Web, API, and SSH services.
* 🔄 **Server Controls**: Safe 1-click start, stop, and restart controls for core services.
* 📜 **Live Audit Log Viewer**: Real-time server and access logs with auto-refresh and secure log-clearing.
* 🔒 **Hardened Security**: Timing-safe token authentication (`secrets.compare_digest`), IP rate-limiting with lockout protection, upload extension verification, and HTTP security headers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📱 Running on Android (Termux)

1. **Install Termux and Termux:API** from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).
2. **Open Termux** and install required packages:
   ```bash
   pkg update -y
   pkg install -y python git termux-api
   ```
3. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvlabs/mobile-hosted-server.git ~/server
   cd ~/server
   ```
4. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   bash start-all.sh
   ```
6. **Open the Dashboard**:
   The terminal will display your local IP. Open your browser on any device on the same Wi-Fi:
   ```text
   http://<PHONE_IP>:8080
   ```

### 💻 Running Locally on Windows / macOS / Linux

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvlabs/mobile-hosted-server.git
   cd mobile-hosted-server
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Launch the server**:
   * **Windows (One-Click)**: Double-click `start-local.bat`
   * **Any OS (Terminal)**:
     ```bash
     python run_local.py
     ```
   The runner will start both services, output your access token, and automatically open the dashboard in your default browser.

## 🔒 Security Model

* **Sandboxed Storage**: File Manager access is strictly confined to `~/server/shared/`. Path traversal (`../`, absolute paths, symlinks) is blocked via sanitized path resolution.
* **Token Authentication**: Modifying files, server controls, and logs require the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. A cryptographically random token is generated on initial run in `.token`.
* **Private Network First**: CORS is constrained to private network subnets (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x, localhost).
* **Safe Error Handling**: Unhandled errors return sanitized JSON responses without leaking Python tracebacks.
